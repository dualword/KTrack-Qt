0.1 to 0.1.1

- More straightforward entering of longitude and latitude
- The xplanet error is now only reported once
- Added DCOP Interface
- Changed tracking routines to sgp4sdp4 - nothing of predict left
- Squint calculations
- A lot of bug fixes in the trx control

0.1.1 to 0.2

- Hamlibized - transceiver control is now 100% hamlib - no code
  left from my own control of the IC910
- Supports different uplink / downlink rig
- completly rewrite of some areas

0.2 to 0.2.1

- Fodtrack driver removed - rotor control is now also completly done
  by hamlib
- some bug fixes
- better xplanet handling

0.2.1 to 0.2.2

- Fixed an bug, where the unable to init rig message appears, if the user
  has selected 'none' in the rig control
- Fixed the bug that caused ktrack to crash, if one of the selected rigs are
  'none'
- The rigs in the rigconfig comboboxes are now sorted alphabetically
- Only satellites that are displayed are now calculated. The previous version
  calculated them all, even if not displayed
- Much faster AOS / LOS calculation routines
- Only calculate AOS for satellites that actually can reach our position
- Removed the possibility to not correct the downlink... now the real way of
  doppler correction is always used!
- Removed every reference to the obsolete fodtrack driver that was still in
  the source tree from ktrack

0.2.2 to 0.3.0-alpha1

- Every satellite, that as an positive elevation will be in red color in the
  satellite list at the bottom of the ktrack main window.
- On the map, every satellite that is not in the observers range is now
  displayed in the gray.
- Changed the code, so that we don't get most of the warnings we had before.
- Macros for the xplanetmap... %slon and %slat for the coordinates of the
  tracked satellite. Additionally an radius to supply with the -radius option
  to xplanet is calculated, using the footprint to give an optimal zoom.
  (%radius)
- Instead of the message box if an xplanet error occurs, an logfile of the
  messages is written to the ktrack files directory. The problem with the
  message box is related with the data we get from KProcess.
- The last used correction value is now saved for each used transponder
  during the last session. On exit, the corrected downlink is saved, so that
  with 0 offset the user sees the frequency on the next startup as if he had
  Manually entered is last offset again
- New easier to use transponder definition dialogues.
- Now, only one Instance of the application can be used / user
- Ported to XPlanet 1.0.1 Will not work with earlier versions

0.3.0-alpha1 to 0.3.0-beta1

- Rewrote completly how the satellites get calculated internally
- Major update of the Radio Control interface
- Removed completly the xplanet wrapper code. Now we have our own Map implematation
