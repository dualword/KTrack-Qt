README for KTRACK

Thanks you for trying out ktrack. Please be informed that this software is
still considered as UNSTABLE - it runs fine on my system, but that doesn't mean
that it does so on your system. If you have a problem - feature request,
simply send me a mail about your issue. There mails will encourage me to
work on the package. Without feedback it could just die ;-)

Requisites

The Program needs at least QT3 and kdelibs-3.x.x Installed. It would be
fine if you have also kdebase-3.x.x installed, but it _should_ run without
that. You also need to have an recent version of hamlib. Hamlib is used to
controll your hardware such as Rotator controllers or Transceivers

Installing

1. Get hamlib. You will need at least an 1.1.4 Release. You can get it at
   http://hamlib.sourceforge.net

2. Install ktrack

   ./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix` && make && make install
   
Usage:

First get a recent set of Kepler elements, and put them into ~/.kde/share/apps/ktrack or
<KDEPREFIX>/share/apps/ktrack - the latter is for all users, the first one only for the
current user. I suggest downloading them from http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements,
as they do work without modification. Please note, the elements file must be renamed to
nasa.tle.

Configure your devices --> open Options - Rig control, put in the values you need
Configure your location -->     Options - Groundstation data

Select the satellites you will be able to track --> Satellite - Selection

Define the transponders on the satellite --> Satellite - Transponder definition
  IMPORTANT: All frequencies have to be entered in Hz!

General operating:

In the main screen you will see the Transceiver panel, the map and the list of satellites.
To track a satellite klick on it on the list. The first transponder definition will be
transferred to the Transceiver. From now on, the frequencies will be corrected for doppler
shift. You can pause this correction by activiating 'Pause Correction' If you only want
to update the uplink, deactivate 'Correct Downlink'

You can use the 'correction Box' to compensate drifts.

Note: Use your transceiver to tune on the transponder - it is the best interface you can get
